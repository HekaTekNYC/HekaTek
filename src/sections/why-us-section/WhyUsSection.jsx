              Tired of Poor Website Experiences?
            </p>
            <p className="why-p">
              Investing in a website can be daunting, especially for small
              businesses. Many invest a significant amount upfront, only to be
              disappointed by slow loading times, overused templates, and
              inconsistent displays. This harms visitor experience and your
              brand reputation.
            </p>
            <p className="landing-subheader">You Deserve Better</p>
            <p className="why-p">
              We’ve seen this frustration firsthand. You deserve a professional,
              hand-coded website that truly represents your brand without
              breaking the bank. That’s why we decided to do things differently
              — starting with a free website audit to identify what your current
              website really needs, and offering flexible, custom-coded
              solutions that put you first.
            </p>
            <p className="landing-subheader">Our Solution </p>
            <p className="why-p">
              Get a high-quality, custom-coded website starting at $150 a month,
              providing confidence in your investment. This gives you a fast,
              unique, and reliable online presence. Prefer a one-time payment?
              We offer a lump sum option as well.
